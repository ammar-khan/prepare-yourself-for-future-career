## How to Write Resume

### Use the right order
---
You have three main types of resumes to choose from:

- Chronological: Focuses on professional experience, listed in reverse chronological order. Most resumes use this format.
- Functional: Emphasizes a large skills section over work history.
- Combination: Gives equal space to your skills and work experience sections.

Pick the resume format that lets you place your most relevant skills and accomplishments in prominent positions where the hiring manager will quickly notice them.

### Don’t make it too long
---
Submit a one-page resume whenever possible so the hiring manager can quickly skim your qualifications and determine you’re hireable. Per professional resume standards, your resume length can reach 2–3 pages only when you have 10+ years of experience or if you’re submitting a federal resume or a CV.

### Pick a readable font
---
The best fonts for a resume are easy to read. Here are a few fonts that follow resume formatting guidelines and clearly present your qualifications to hiring managers:

- Cambria
- Calibri
- Times New Roman

### Choose the best font size
---
Resume font size matters. Set your font size anywhere between 10.5 and 12 — whatever size best fills the page.

### Set your margins to the ideal width
---
The best size for resume margins is between ½” and 1”. Margins wider than an inch create too much blank space that makes your resume appear empty. Sub-½” margins spread out your information, making it hard to read.

### Feature your name in a header
---
You’re the star of your resume, so don’t be shy when you format your name on your resume header. Write your name in extra-large, bold text, and then list your contact information in the same font size you use for the rest of your resume.

### Add a bit of color
---
Make your resume visually appealing to the hiring manager by including a touch of color. Use a resume template created by a professional designer to ensure your resume has a good balance of color, black text, and white space.

Also, think about what colors are appropriate for the type of job you’re applying for. For example, if you’re applying to work at a company in a traditional industry like banking, use a neutral color, such as dark green. But if you’re targeting a graphic design position at a progressive tech startup, you might want to use brighter shades of red or blue.

>Another way to splash some color onto your resume is by using [resume icons](https://resumegenius.com/blog/resume-help/resume-icons) to accent your contact information and headers.

### Write a catchy resume headline
---
Overcome stiff competition in the 2022 job market by writing a resume headline. Also known as a resume title, the 1–2 line phrase succinctly sums up your qualifications to convince the hiring manager to continue reading your resume.

### Highlight your skills in a resume intro
---
List your most relevant skills and accomplishments in a brief introduction under your headline. A resume introduction is 2–3 sentences or bullets filled with information that makes the hiring manager want to read all your resume sections.

### List your professional accomplishments
---
Present your accomplishments in your resume’s work experience section. Organize your achievements in 2–4 bullets under each job title so employers can understand what you’re capable of doing for them if they hire you.

### Use hard numbers
---
Don’t merely say you have skills and accomplishments on your resume. Instead, support them with hard numbers (percentages and dollar amounts) and specific examples that show the hiring manager why you’re qualified.

### Emphasize your education
---
Put your highest degree title and school name in your resume’s education section. If you don’t have much work experience, you can also list relevant coursework on your resume.

### Add your skills
---
List your hard and soft skills in a bulleted resume skills section. Include any language skills, computer skills, and certifications that could benefit your target employer.

### Include other relevant information
---
If you have volunteer experience, extracurricular activities, or interests that are related to the job you want, add them to your resume. If possible, quantify the experience and hobbies you add with data to avoid having this additional information dismissed as resume fluff.

### Don’t use pronouns
---
One important resume guideline is to omit pronouns. You shouldn’t say “I” in a resume for two reasons:

- Cutting straight to the verb is more concise, taking the hiring manager directly to your qualifications. So instead of saying “I optimized our file organization,” say “Optimized file organization.”
- Repeating “I” and “me” throughout your resume could read as bragging.

>Hiring managers know that when you refer to an accomplishment or responsibility on your resume that you’re talking about yourself. You don’t need to start sentences with first person pronouns like I, me, us, my, or we.

### Do use action words
---
Use [action verbs](https://resumegenius.com/blog/resume-help/action-verbs) and [powerful adjectives](https://resumegenius.com/blog/resume-help/resume-adjectives) to describe your achievements. Replace a bland word like “made” with “innovated” and instantly boost your resume’s intensity.

### Consider ATS
---
Applicant tracking software (ATS) that automatically filters applications based on preset resume [keywords](https://resumegenius.com/blog/resume-help/resume-keywords) is gaining popularity among companies of all sizes. Include skills-based terms from the job ad on your resume to get it past the ATS to the hiring manager.

### Don’t submit the same resume twice
---
Fine-tune your resume for every new job application you submit. Employers search for candidates who meet the specific requirements listed in the job descriptions, and if your resume has too much irrelevant information, it may be trashed.

### Proofread
---
Ensure your resume is mistake-free by proofreading. Your resume introduces you to employers, and a single mistake can give the first impression that you’re careless and unprofessional.

### Ask a friend to proofread
---
After you’ve proofread your resume, ask someone else to look it over. When you’re crafting your resume, your brain automatically prioritizes meaning over small mistakes like typos and grammatical miscues. Someone who’s reading the information you’ve been agonizing over for the first time can catch minor errors you missed.

### Save your resume as a PDF file
---
You should send the hiring manager a PDF resume because:

- PDF files are the easiest to open in most computer operating systems
- Saving your resume as a PDF file removes the visually jarring underlines that Word’s spellchecker places on terms it doesn’t recognize.

### Include a cover letter
---
Write a cover letter that expands on the concise qualifications listed on your resume and attach it to your application. A cover letter’s paragraph format gives you more space to explain why you want the job, drop a company contact’s name, and show that you’ve researched the organization.

### Mentioning Skills
---
**Systems-oriented** skills are associated with your areas of expertise. Under each role listed on your résumé, try to phrase these skills in a practical way to show how they can apply to a variety of positions and industries, not just your specified field. For example, suppose you worked as a content creator at a software company. In that case, highlight “business writing” on your résumé and specify what you mean by including more distinct tasks — like creating blog posts or writing marketing emails — under your role. Doing so will help prove that you can apply this skill to any job rather than just at a software company.

**People-oriented** skills highlight your ability to communicate with colleagues. Right now, companies value candidates who can collaborate remotely and have the potential to lead virtual teams. On your résumé, be sure to include keywords like performance management, virtual training, and task delegation, either under a particular role or a separate “skills” section at the bottom of your résumé to demonstrate your ability to collaborate and lead.

**Self-oriented** skills tell your potential employer that you can work diligently, learn quickly, and apply new solutions to existing problems, like the ones caused by the shift to remote work (decreasing productivity, burnout, etc.). You might think of these as “soft” skills, but they are in demand and will help you stand out as companies continue to decentralize their workforces. Words like “autonomy,” “time management,” and “self-starter” show employers you can stay on task, remotely or otherwise.
