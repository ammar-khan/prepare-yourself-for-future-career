### Understanding of Requirements

As human mind evolving continiously; generations and technologies are changing rapidly 
we need to make sure we will meet the mindset needed for the future.

**Wisdom Age**

Developed later in the 1700s, there is a saying, 
>Jack of all trades master of none

And that was true till 2008.
But after 2008, we have enough information available on Internet, we don't need a master of one anymore.

Employer now a days need someone smart enough to use and analyse available information and choose what is more suitable and best fit for the organisation.

Therefore a candidate who has more knowledge & understanding of moving pieces related to the job (including experience, education, certifications, tools etc.) 
is ideal to connect all dots without waiting for someone to do the work

Ideal candidates should have, can do attitute of learning & doing new things.

Having technical skills are not enough, ideal candidate should have people/personal skills or soft skills and these skills are more important for the employers now a days, because learning new skills are easier then changing behaviour.

Ideal candidate should possess People/Personal skills as well as Technical skills.

### Market Yourself
---

Treat your resume as an advertisement.

Lets take an example of Shaving Razor ads.

What makes Shaving Razor advertisement catchy?
- A handsome guy who is already clean shaved 
- A sports car or sports bike, black or red in colour
- A beautiful scenery, where he parked the car or the bike
- A beautiful house and bathroom, where he shave his beard
- A beautiful office and social gathering, where he go after shaving his beard 
- And last and more imortant a beautiful girl (she is not a consumer of Shaving Razor)

>Notice the ads only provide you enough information to attracts you and makes you curious about the product, and you want to spend your time and money to explore more about the product.

>Why a beautiful girl is more important, because she stand out the product from other products.

**I recommend the same for the resume.**

- Think about Applicant Tracking Software (ATS)
  - Use keywords more then other commentary.
- Only provide information which is required to make recruiters/hr curious about you.
- It should stand out 
  - Design, Layout, Colours etc.

Remember, your resume should pass two(2) screenings initially:
- **Applicant Tracking Software (ATS)** - by providing all required keywords
- **Recruiter / HR person** - by standing out and develop curiosity

### Standing out your resume from the crowd (Win Win)
---
**Applicant Tracking Software (ATS)**

On average 1 job recieves 25 applications and out of 25 only top 1-2 candidates from the list filtered by ATS will be contacted.

> Use as much keywords mentioned in job description, to keep you at the top of the list.

**Recruiter / HR person**

> Resume design, layout and colours makes it unique and stand out
> 
> Content of resume should develop curiosity to explore more about you.

### Resume file format

Alway sent PDF file of your resume, it is easy to transfer to different machines as well as it keeps the original layout, fonts and images.

>Keep a word format or plain PDF format of your resume as well, because sometime recruiters wants to copy/paste resume to their own template, without your contact information and pass it to the employer.

### Prepare for the interview
In most cases there are two(2) initial interviews
- Interview with Recruiter 
- Interview with Employer

Prepare yourself (mentioned in this guide) for the interview 

Write your best answer using STAR method

>Remember, interview is bi directional 
>
>Employer will ask about services you can provide
>
>Employee will ask about growth, learning, incentives and culture of the organisation

>**Note**: Interview is very important and crucial part, so be prepare and pay attention, if you are going to join a right organisation where you can grow or a toxic organisation, before signing the contract (Analysing Company Culture is also available in this guide). 

**Interview with Recruiters**

- Tell brief about you
- 1-2 recent projects using STAR method
- Define and ask about opportunities, organisation, incentives, salary and culture you are looking for (This will help recruiter to understand your requirements).

**Interview with Employer**
- Tell brief about you (more technical)
- Tell technical achievements using STAR method 
- Ask about oportunities within organisation, incentives, salary, culture of the company and ways of working.
- Ask the outcome of the interview (this gives you an oportunity to get some indication about the outcome as well as it gives you opportunity to add more details to what employer is looking for.
- Negotiate if required
