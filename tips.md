#### Why to Prepare for Future Career
---

##### Understanding of Requirements
---

As human thinking and mind evolving continiously, we need new challenges to meet.

As human generations and technologies are changing rapidly we need to make sure we will meet the mindset needed for the future.

---
From 200,000,000 BC to 1,200 BC, humans transform materials like (Stone age):
- Stone tools
- Bronze tools
- Iron tools

From 1780 to 1973, humans transform energy like (industrial age):
- Water power
- Steam power
- Electric power
- Combustion power

From 1974 to 2008, humans were communication and storing information (Technology & Information age)

From 2008 onwards, humans are computing and analysing information (Wisdom age)

---

There is a saying, developed later in the 1700s
>Jack of all trades master of none

And that was true till 2008.
But after 2008, we have enough information available on Google about things and procedures in text, audio and video formats that we don't need a master of one.

Employer now a days need someone smart enough to use and analyse stored information and pick what is more suitable and best fit for the organisation.

Therefore a candidate who has more knowlwdge &understanding of most of the moving pieces related to the industry (including experience, education, certifications, tools etc.) and having can do attitute of learning new things, is ideal to connect all dot without waiting for someone to do the work.

Having more technical knowledge is also not enough, ideal candidate should have people/personal skills or soft skills and these skills are more important for the employers now a days, because learning new skills are easier then changing behaviour.

Ideal candidate should be a master and more focused on People/Personal skills then Tech skills.

##### Market Yourself
---

Treat resume as your television advertisement like Shaving Razor ads.

What makes Shaving Razor advertisement catchy:
- A handsome guy aleady clean shaved 
- A sports car or sports motor bike, black or red in colour
- A beautiful background where he parked the car or the bike
- A beautiful house and bathroom where he shave
- A beautiful office and social gathering where he go after shaving his beard 
- And last and more imortant a beautiful girl (which has no direct link with the Shaving Razor)

>Notice the ads only provide you enough information which attracts you and makes you curious about the product, and you want to spend your time and money to explore more about the product.

>Why a beautiful girl is more important, because she stand out the product from other products.
> Example, you have 50 white active & healthy chickens and 1 a lazy brown one, you will noticed, the brown one stand out always, does not matter she is active or lazy.

**I recommend the same for the resume.**

- Think about Applicant Tracking Software (ATS)
  - Use keywords more then other commentary.
- Only provide information which is required (not less nor more).
  - Add curiosity to the recruiters/hr to contact you and know more about you
- It should stand out 
  - Design, Layout, Colours etc.

Remember, your resume will go though 2 screenings innitially:
- Applicant Tracking Software (ATS)
- Recruiter / HR person

You need your resume to pass both screening:

**ATS** by providing all required keywords

**Person** by standing out and develop curiosity

##### Standing out from the crowd (Win Win)
---
**ATS**

Imagine if you are applying for a job in a company looking for 2 candidates. 

Its not only you who is applying for that job, on average 1 job recieves 25 applications and out of 25 only top 2 candidates from the list will be contacted which is filtered by ATS based on keywords matched.

Design a resume which contains all or maximum number of keywords, so you should always appear in top 2 in the list of matching candicates.

**Person**

You resume design, layout and colours makes it unique and standout for a person looking at it

Content of your resume should develop curiosity in person to book a time with you or explore more.

##### Resume file format

Alway sent PDF file of your resume it is easy to transfer to different machines as well as it keeps the layout, fonts and images intact.

>Keep a word format or plain PDF format of your resume as well, because sometime recruiters want to copy/paste your resume to their company template, without your contact information and pass it to the employer.

##### Prepare for the interview
You will be contact min 2 times for interview
- Recruiter 
- Employer

You should prepare yourself (mentioned in this guide) for the interview 

Write it and learn by heart what to say and how to say.

>Remember, interview now a days is not for hiring you as a resource, it is more about services you will provide

>Employer will interview you about your services you can provide 

>You will interview employer about growth, learning, incentives and culture of the organisation

>**Note**: Interview is very important and crucial part, so be prepare and pay attention if you are going to join a right organisation where you can grow or a toxic organisation. 

**Recruiter Interview**

- Brief history about you
- 1-2 recent projects 
- Focus on what you type of opportunities,organisation, incentives, salary and culture you are looking for.

**Employer Interview**
- Brief history about you
- Technical achievements 
- Focus on oportunities within organisation, incentives, salary and culture of the company.
- Ask the outcome of the interview, this gives you an oportunity to comeup with the outcome as well as give more explaination if any thing employer is looking for.
