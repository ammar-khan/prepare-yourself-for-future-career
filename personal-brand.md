## How to Create a Personal Brand That Enhances Your Job Search

These days the term “branding” means so much more than what comes to mind when you think of a particular company or product. Brands, in the traditional sense, of course still exist, but in this day and age, it’s more critical than ever for individuals to brand themselves, as well.

Developing your own personal brand doesn’t have to be intimidating, though. Here’s a guide to help job seekers craft a personal brand.

### Why Do You Need a Personal Brand?

Your personal brand is essentially marketing yourself and your career expertise. It signals what you stand for, what you’ve accomplished, and what you’re capable of achieving. Having a personal brand can provide you many benefits when it comes to finding a new job and staying relevant in your career.

- Hiring managers are scouring the web, just like everyone else; for them, the goal is often researching job applicants. Stay ahead of the game by making sure that when your name pops up in a search engine, they’ll find information that’s flattering, informative, and shows you in your best light.
- A consistent personal brand lets potential employers know that you’re goal-oriented and have a master plan for your career—or at least a focused strategy to achieve your goals.
- A consistent personal brand is a marketing tool that serves as your own personal billboard, one that evolves and changes over time. Use your personal brand to tell your own story, explain your core values, and offer details about skills and passions that may not come up in traditional job-search formats.

### How to Create Your Personal Brand

For job seekers, most significant step to developing your personal brand is determining what your brand represents. Your core values are the heart of your brand. It is the foundation for all of your communication strategies. Ask yourself a few questions. What motivates you to get up in the morning and tackle the day? Why are you unique? What are you passionate about?

When you begin to answer these questions, your personal brand will take shape. Once you have discovered your core values, you can easily draft your personal vision statement. Your vision statement will serve as your guiding light and will keep you in check as you continue your search and promote yourself.

You might think that “writer,” “illustrator,” or “content creator” is enough of a personal brand, but really, those are just job titles. To develop your actual brand, you’ll need to put a little more thought into what it is that you actually create (or hope to create) on a daily basis with your work.

For example, perhaps as an illustrator you’re well known for your quirky caricatures, or as a writer you’ve really cornered the market on crypto-currency, international travel, or single parenting. Whatever it is you’re best at in your particular job, own it and flaunt it in every way possible. Here’s a few ways to promote your niche talents.

### Promoting Your Personal Brand

### Personal Branding Mistakes to Avoid
---
**An Unfocused Brand**
Yes, you’d like to snag a job as a writer—but you also are addicted to pug videos. But posting memes of pugs skydiving won’t get you a job. The goal of brand building is to create a consistent message so that people automatically equate you with what you do best.

So instead of fawning over a pug puppy pic, show off some of your most recent written work. It will help reinforce your professional skills and help hiring managers when they search your social media profiles.

**Excessive Self-Praising**
This is very similar to overselling, but with more of a focus on how great you are and how employers simply can’t operate without you. The cold hard truth is that people will lose interest quickly and this in turn will hurt your image. [Self-promote wisely](./self-marketing.md).

**Infrequent Posting**
Developing a personal brand isn’t a one-and-done process, it’ll require constant upkeep and checking in.

That means you should always share your own work, as well as the work of others that you find interesting or that is in line with your own brand objectives and goals.

**Divulging Too Much Info**
Sure, social media is meant for sharing thoughts, ideas, likes, and dislikes, but you have to be careful what you put out there.

You don’t want to broadcast a fight with your partner when you’re trying to get a new job. Although you do need to share some parts of your personal life online (that’s how you create an audience, after all), you want to be selective and thoughtful in your approach.
